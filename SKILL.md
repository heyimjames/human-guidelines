# UI Guidelines

Make interfaces feel crafted by humans, not generated by algorithms.

## Interview Mode

When the user says "interview", "help me define my taste", or "what's my style":

Run through these questions one at a time. Wait for answers. Build a taste profile.

1. **Pick 3 adjectives** for how your product should feel
2. **What apps do you love using?** (for how they feel, not features)
3. **What do you hate in interfaces?**
4. **Spatial preference**: Dense or spacious?
5. **Animation personality**: Snappy or playful?
6. **Color mood**: Monochromatic? Warm? Cool? Bold?
7. **Typography character**: Neutral or distinctive?
8. **What's the one thing that would make it feel "you"?**

Output a **Taste Profile** summary they can save.

## UI Quick Reference

### Taste & Craft
- Taste is having opinions—AI has none
- Collect references obsessively
- Define your vibe and commit
- Handcrafted details compound
- Prioritize feel over features (in product UI, "feel" = responsiveness and flow; on marketing pages, "feel" = mood and first impressions)

### Micro-interactions
- Animation is personality—choose deliberately
- Use spring physics over bezier curves
- Stagger list reveals (30-50ms delay)
- Design exits as carefully as entrances
- Every interactive element needs hover feedback
- Scale animation to context: marketing can be dramatic; product UI should be invisible by the 5th view

### Key Checks
- **Dark mode**: Never pure black (#000000), use #1a1a1a
- **Typography**: text-wrap: pretty, vary fonts
- **Animation**: Organic easing, imperfect timing
- **Layout**: Asymmetry for marketing; consistent grids for product UI
- **Icons**: Three states (stroke/duotone/solid)
- **Density**: Marketing wants space; product UI depends on use case (dense for dashboards, spacious for onboarding)

### Surface-Specific Guidance

**Marketing & Landing Pages:**
- First impression is everything—hero, scroll pacing, narrative flow
- Brand expression lives here—be brave with creative risks
- Social proof needs craft—real quotes, specific numbers, genuine photography
- CTAs should feel inevitable, not pushy
- Performance is invisible design—Core Web Vitals affect SEO and trust

**In-App Product UI:**
- Consistency beats novelty—users build muscle memory
- Design for the 100th session, not the 1st
- States are the real design work—loading, empty, error, partial, offline
- Power users are watching—keyboard shortcuts, bulk actions, density toggles
- Data is content—tables, charts, and lists deserve the same care as a hero section
- Template patterns are a feature here—the craft is in execution quality, not structural novelty
- Empty states are your biggest opportunity—they're the first thing new users see

# Writing Guidelines

Make AI-generated writing feel like a human wrote it.

## Writing Quick Reference

Priority order for humanizing text:

1. **Kill preamble** - Remove "Certainly!", "Great question!", "I'd be happy to help"
2. **Ban AI vocabulary** - Replace "delve", "utilize", "leverage", "facilitate", "comprehensive"
3. **Use contractions** - "don't" not "do not", "it's" not "it is"
4. **Vary sentence rhythm** - Mix short punchy sentences with longer flowing ones
5. **Get specific** - Replace vague claims with concrete details
6. **Cut filler** - Remove "It's important to note that", "In order to"
7. **Sound opinionated** - Take stances instead of hedging everything

## Writing Usage

1. Analyze text against all rules
2. List specific violations found
3. Provide rewritten version with fixes applied

# Social Media Guidelines

Make social posts feel like a person sharing, not a brand broadcasting.

## Social Quick Reference

### Universal Fixes
1. **Remove hashtag walls** - Keep 0-2 max, or none
2. **Delete corporate openers** - "I'm thrilled to announce", "Excited to share"
3. **Cut emoji bullets** - Those checkmark/rocket/star lists are AI tells
4. **Use lowercase** - Sentence case feels more human
5. **Strategic imperfection** - Occasional typo is okay
6. **Be specific** - "shipped the thing" > "successfully launched our innovative solution"

### Platform-Specific

**X/Twitter**: Hot takes, no hashtag walls, embrace brevity
**LinkedIn**: Specific wins, no "Agree?" prompts, real stories
**Instagram**: Visual-first, short captions
**TikTok**: Authentic moments, hook in 2 seconds

## Social Usage

1. Ask which platform if not specified
2. Apply platform-specific rules
3. Output post with humanization applied
4. Offer 2-3 variations if helpful
